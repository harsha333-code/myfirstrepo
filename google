Random testing is a black-box 
software testing technique where programs are
tested by generating random, independent inputs. Results of the output are 
\compared against software specifications to verify that the test output is pass or fail.[1]\
In case of absence of specifications the exceptions of the language are used which means if an exception arises during test
execution then it means
there is a fault in the program,
it is also used as a way to avoid biased testing.
